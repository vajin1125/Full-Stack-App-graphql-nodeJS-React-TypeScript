# Building a GraphQL API with TypeScript + Node.js, React

This is a perfect source code to how to use GraphQL, TypeScript, NodeJS and React.

## Project structure
    graphql-be    # Final version of the backend API code.
    graphql-fe    # Final version of the frontend code.
    
Note: for a production-ready application, we should be changing the synchronize property in the data-source.ts file to false and use the concept of DB migrations instead which is supported by TypeORM out of the box.
